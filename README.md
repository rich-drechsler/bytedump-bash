# Bytedump - Bash Version

A big bash script with lots of comments that basically just postprocesses the
output of xxd. Even though it works (on Linux) it's definitely not supposed to
be used to dump the bytes in anything other than very small files. Instead, my
hope is that parts of the source code might be useful to people writing bash
scripts. I think there are some worthwhile things in the script - hopefully
the comments in the code will help you find them.

At the very least this is an excellent example of something that should not be
tackled by a bash script. I'm retired, so that doesn't make a difference to me,
but I'm sure the bosses I had over the years would not have approved if I spent
any work time on this script. Bash is fine for small scripts, but this is way
beyond that.
